    "The goal of the data engineer is to unlock an organization's data ecosystem to a wide group of analysts, data scientists, or any other interested member. Sure, we could share the SQLite file around to every interested user, but what if there were 10,000 people interested in the data? SQLite does not scale well for that use case so we require a better choice.\n",

    "To serve such a vast amount of users, we would be better off using another database engine. In this course we'll use an open source relational database management system (RDBMS) called **Postgres**. Postgres is a much more robust engine that is implemented as a server rather than a single file. As a server, Postgres accepts connections from clients who can run queries like a **SELECT, INSERT**, or any other type of SQL query making the data accessible to a wide range of people.\n",

This is a fundamental skill that any data engineer should have, as one of the main roles of a data engineer is ensure that data is readily available and stored in a way that makes accessing it easy and efficient.

    "In order to communicate with our Postgres server, we will be using the open source psycopg2 Python library. You can think of **psycopg2** being similar to connecting to a SQLite database using the sqlite3 library.\n",

    "To connect to the database we use the *psycopg2.connect()* function by passing it a string containing the name of the database to which we want to connect to as well as our username. So, to connect to a database named dq using psycopg2, a user named Rose we would do the following:\n",

Without those values attached, Postgres will not know who is trying to connect and where so it will fail. Once Rose is connected, she is ready to take advantage of the features Postgres has.\n",
